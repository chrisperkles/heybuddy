# Offline Stories

Place your pre-recorded WAV story files in this directory.

The files should be:
- 16kHz sample rate
- Mono (1 channel)
- WAV format
- Child-appropriate content

Example files:
- sample1.wav - A happy adventure story
- sample2.wav - A bedtime story
- sample3.wav - A learning story about animals

When the app is offline or API keys are missing, it will randomly select one of these files to play to the child.
